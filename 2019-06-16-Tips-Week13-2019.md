# Note of How To Win A Data Science Competition (Updated)

## 1.0 Overview
## 1.1 Recap of main ML algorithms
## 1.2 Feature preprocessing and generation with respect to models

### 1.2.1 Numeric features



### 1.2.2 Categorical and ordinal features

#### Label encoding (Linear, tree-based models)

1. Alphabetical(sorted)

   `sklearn.preprocessing.LableEncoder`

2. Order of appearance

   `Pandas.factorize`

3. Frequency encoding 

   ```python
   [S,C,Q] -> [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]

   encoding = titanic.groupby('Embarked').size()
   encoding = encoding/len(titanico)
   titanic['enc'] = titanic.Embarked.map(encoding)

   ```

   if you have multiple categories with the same frequency

   `from scipy.stats import rankdata`

#### One-hot encoding (Linear, KNN, neural netowrk)

`pandas.get_dummies`,`sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`

#### Interactions of categorical features

![4.png](4.png)

#### Summarize

1. Values on ordinal features are sorted in some meaningful order

2. Label encoding maps categories to numbers
3. Frequency encoding maps categories to their frequencies
4. Label and Frequency encodings are often used for tree-based models
5. One-hot encoding in often used for non-tree-based models
6. Interactions of categorical features can help linear models and KNN.



### 1.2.3 Datetime and coordinates

### 1.2.4 Handing missing values

## 1.3 Feature extraction from text and images

## 2.1 Exploratory data analysis

### Important Exploratory steps

- **Get domain knowlegde**

  - It helps to deeper understand the problem

- **Check if the data is intuitive**

  - And agrees with domain knowledge

- **Understand how the data was generated**

  - As it is crucial to set up a proper validation

### Exploring anonymized data

TODO

### Visualizations

- Explore individual features
  - Histograms:

    `plt.hist(x)`

  - Plots(index versus value):

    `plt.plot(x, '.')`

  - Statistics:

    `df.describe()`
    `x.mean()`
    `x.var()`

  - Other tools:

    `x.value_conts()`
    `x.isnull()`

- Explore feature relations
  
  - Pairs
    - Scatter plots

      `plt.scatter(x1, x2)`

      `pd.scatter_matrix(df)`

    - Correlation plots

       `df.corr()`

       `plt.matshow(...)`

  - Groups:

    - Correlation plots + clustering

    - Plot(index vs feature statistics)

      `df.mean().sort_values().plot(style='.')`

  - generate new features

### Dataset cleaning and other things to check

- Dataset cleaning

  - Constant features

  - Duplicated features

- Other thins to check

  - Duplicated rows

  - Check if dataset is shuffled

### EDA check list

- Get domain knowledge
- Check if the data is intuitive
- Understand how the data was generated

---

- Explore indeividual features
- Explore pairs and groups

---

- Clean features up
- Check for leaks!
