# Comments of xDeepFM: Combining Explicit and Implicit Feature Interactions for Recommenders Systems

## First Reading

1. a CIN, which aims to generate feature interactions in an explicit fashion and at the vector-wise level.

2. A new model combine a CIN and a classical DNN, named eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine(xDeepFM)


3. Contributions:

   - We propose a novel model, named eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (**xDeepFM**), that jointly learns explicit and implicit high-order feature interactions effectively and requires no manual feature engineering.

   - We design a compressed interaction network (CIN) in xDeepFM that learns high-order feature interactions explicitly. We show that the degree of feature interactions increases at each layer, and features interact at the vector-wise level rather than the bit-wise level.

   - We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world dataset, and the results demonstrate that our xDeepFM outperforms several state-of-the-art models significantly.

## First Reading Qustion:

- Feature Ineractions: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_interaction_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_interaction_problem)

- Combinatorial features

- CIN?

- an explicit and implicit fashion?

- the vector-wise?bounded-degree featurefeature interactions

- low- and high-order feature

## Second reading

- *cross features* or *multi-way features* : cross-product transformation over categorical features

### Compressed Interaction Network

1. interactions are applied at vector-wise level, not at bit-wise level

2. high-order feature interactions is measured explicitly

3. the complexity of network will not grow exponentially with the degree of interactions.
